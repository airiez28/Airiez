					<h2>Final Project</h2>
				<p>For our final project, we decided to make this product called the Smartmat - this mat is intended to take the temperature of food while we eat as us architecture students do our work.
				<br/>This is because as Architecture students, we get distracted with our work and we would often end up scalding our tongue as we wont be able to keep track on how hot our food is. Therefore, we decided to make this product.</p>
				<p>For this project, me and rifky were in charge of the embeding the Arduino micro controller with code as well as connecting the parts together
				<br/> jeanine was in charge of lazer cutting and Kunteng was to 3D print the parts</p>
				
				<p> For programming we had problems with the code at first so we diced to ask steven for help.
				<br/> he directed us by telling us to download libraries for the hardware that we were using as well as giving us examples to follow. We downloaded the adafruit library for the DHT sensor as well as the I2C library for the backpack and LCD.
				</p>
				
				<p> In the end this was the final code <p>
