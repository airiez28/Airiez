					<h2>3D printing</h2>
				<p>For 3d printing, we were introduced to softwares such as cura, and our knowledge on the software Fusion360 was expanded. We were taught how to mesh and slice objects as well as taught safety rules so we could keep ourselves safe while in the digital fabrication laboratory</p>
				<p> an example of how cura is used</p>

				<p> After slicing it in cura, it is then put into an SD card and is then printed by the 3D printer.
				<br/> here are some examples of objects that i have 3d printed.

				<p> Another example of pieces that have been 3D printed is the 4 person project me and my groupmates, Jeanine, KunTeng and Rifky. for this, we actually 3D pinted objects that tested the limits of the 3d printer such as objects that test infill, overhang, bridging and clearance. </p>
